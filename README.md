## Overview

This project is dedicated to assisting **malware analysts, researchers, and cybersecurity professionals** by providing a centralized resource for locating virus samples. These samples are intended for **in-depth analysis, research, reverse engineering**, or **educational review**.

Sourcing malware can be a complex and daunting task, often requiring knowledge of obscure or hard-to-access repositories. To address this, we have created a comprehensive, **living repository** that aggregates credible malware sources to streamline your workflow and enhance your ability to study and combat malicious software.

## Important Warning

> **These are live, dangerous malware samples!**

The files listed in this repository were created with malicious intent and **can cause significant harm if mishandled**.  
**Do NOT execute or run these files unless you are absolutely certain of what you are doing.**

They are intended **strictly for educational and research purposes only.**

We cannot stress enough the importance of handling these files with extreme caution. Mishandling malware can lead to:

- Unintended infections
- Data loss
- System compromise

### Recommended Safety Measures

- Use a **secure, sandboxed environment** or a **dedicated Virtual Machine (VM)** with no Internet access.
- **Isolate analysis systems** from critical infrastructure.
- Keep **network connectivity disabled** during analysis.
- Employ **professional malware analysis tools** to inspect the code safely.

## Usage Guidelines

Follow these best practices to safely work with malware samples:

1. **Use a Sandboxed Environment:**  
   Analyze samples in a controlled and isolated setup like a VM or sandbox.

2. **Disable Internet Access:**  
   Prevent malware from contacting command-and-control servers or spreading.

3. **Backup Critical Systems:**  
   Ensure critical data is backed up and isolated before starting analysis.

4. **Use Specialized Tools:**  
   Leverage disassemblers, debuggers, and network monitoring tools for analysis.

5. **Follow Legal and Ethical Guidelines:**  
   Make sure your usage complies with all applicable laws and ethical standards.
